# Why should we use functions at all? We should use function because it saves our typing
# How to define/declare a function? We use def_function(parameters): function's argument
# How to call/use a function? We must import a library
# What is return, why and how do we use it? return pushes the result of the function (or makes funciton a value of a varibale)
# Do we have to use return in every function? Not every function needs to return a value. Some just don't. If all you want is to print the number, then you don't really need to return it (copy from codecademy)
# What are function arguments/parameters, why and how we use it? It is the syntax of a function, we could leave it blank
# How to use function from a different file other than our currently working file? from name_of_file import function
